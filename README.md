# Gea the Rock
---
## Description 

### Gea the Rock is an educational game about the formation of all 4 different types of exoplanets.  This game was developed at the BrickHack9 hackathon hosted by Rochester institute of Technology.  This was the first game I had ever developed start to finish and it was all a really awesome learning experience!  Working with 3 artists also presented new challenges but ultimately allowed for a truly beautiful game.  This is absolutely still my prettiest game to date (thanks teammates!).

## Notes
- This game was developed during a 24 hour hackathon with a team of four, including myself!
  - All art was created by my team!
  - Teammates:
    - Zach Glidden: Created all UI for the game screens.
    - TJ Hampton: Designed all the animations and general game assets
    - Troy Ramiscal: Wrote and created the assets for all narrative aspects of the game.
- My main role in this project was the full-stack programmer.  from the physics system to make the game feel 'spacey' to the UI classes that contain all the necessary code for buttons
  - I learned a lot about the process of developing a game from this project.
  - I also learned what working with artists who do not know how to program is like!
    - Acquiring the ability to talk about technical concepts while maintaining attention and understanding is shockingly difficult!
  - It was an awesome experience and even though we did not win anything I still had a blast!
